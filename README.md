# opentext-viewer

## Dynamic text viewing

- a single html file that selects XML files from the local folder, and load associated stylesheet
- javascript where you can check on and off certain modules (i.e., HTML tag + specific attributes and attribute values. These options should be populated on the fly by reading the XML file, but I want to toggle any given option on and off in the DOM using CSS)
- checklist-like functionality 
- make a static web app

## Requirements:

1. index.html page that allows you to select an XML file from subfolders (any xml file in repo basically)
2. load appropriate CSS
3. and populate checkboxes for toggling display
4. populate tooltips or status bar for functions/values... [confer with Chris about this]

## Deploying

Should be deployed as a netlify or vercel static app that does all processing on the client side.
